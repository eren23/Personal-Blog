        Hi, My name is Eren. I'm a Computer Engineer from Turkey. I'm working as
        an R&D Engineer and Embedded Software Developer professionally but "I
        hope" this blog will be more about modern web technologies and maybe
        some hands-on applications. You can reach me by using my eMail address
        or going to my website from the "Contact" page.
